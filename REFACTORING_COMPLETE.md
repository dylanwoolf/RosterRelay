**Before:** Monolithic, global scope, mixed concerns  
**After:** Modular, ES6 imports, separation of concerns

### 3. Professional Presentation
**Before:** Basic README, no license, no structure  
**After:** Comprehensive docs, MIT licensed, proper structure

### 4. GitHub Impression
**Before:** Looks like a beginner project  
**After:** Looks like a professional application

### 5. Maintainability

## 🚀 Next Steps (See TODO.md for details)

### Immediate (Critical)
1. **Test the new structure**
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   # Then visit http://localhost:8000
   ```

2. **If tests pass, remove old files**
   ```bash
   rm script.js style.css players.json
   ```

3. **Update README with your GitHub username**
   - Replace `yourusername` in README.md
   - Update repository URLs

### Soon (Important)
4. **Add screenshots**
   - Take screenshots of the game
   - Add to `assets/images/`
   - Update README

5. **Configure GitHub repo**
   - Add description
   - Add topics/tags
   - Enable Pages (optional)

6. **Commit and push**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Refactor: Restructure with modular architecture"
   git push origin main
   ```
